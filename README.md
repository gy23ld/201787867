# Based on the document England's Deprivation Index 2019, and the LSOA (2011) Borders of England document, I wanted to look at whether in Sheffield people in areas with higher levels of deprivation are less likely to have access to housing as well as a good living environment?
# This is because the general perception is that areas with higher deprivation indices mean that they are likely to be more poverty and therefore it is harder for people to access housing or a good living environment. However, the study found that in Sheffield, the ease of access to housing and related services and good living conditions in an area is not positively related to the level of deprivation, and that it is easier for people to access housing and good living conditions in areas with higher deprivation indices. The study also presents a visual representation of areas with higher levels of housing deprivation, which is intended to assist government decision-making.
# The GitHub repository contains the csv file for the deprivation index, the geojson file for the LSOA (2011) for the whole of the UK, and the extracted geojson file for Sheffield.
